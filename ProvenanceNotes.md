#Provenance within the DukeDS 
_work in progress..._


Provenance with DukeDS allows users to create activites and specify relationships among activities and files.

For our purposes an activity is a process that creates or modifies files.

Activities consist of a name, description, started_on and ended_on dates.

Activities have three relationships with files that can be recorded:
* used - a file was used in an activity
* generatedBy - a file was generated by an activity
* invalidatedBy - a file that was invalidated by an activity

There is one file to file relationship possible:
* One file can be derived from another.

Example Activity: DNA Sequenced creating one result/mouse_192.bam file.

Here is an example of a possible file format that could be included in an upload.
```
activities:
  - name: dna_sequenced
    description: DNA sequenced on Minion...
    started_on: 2016-08-17 12:20
    ended_on: 2016-08-17 14:47

relationships:
  - type: generatedBy
    activity: dna_sequenced
    file: result/mouse_192.bam
```
